"""
Vector operation implementations for constant evaluation.

This file contains stub implementations for vector operations that require
more complex logic beyond simple component-wise operations.

These functions are marked as TODO and will need special handling:
- Dot product (requires sum reduction)
- Cross product (3D vector specific)
- Length (requires sqrt of dot product)
- Distance (requires length of difference)
- Normalize (requires division by length)
- Packed dot products (require unpacking)
"""

# NOTE: These functions are left as stubs because they require:
# 1. Vector literal extraction and manipulation
# 2. Reduction operations (sum for dot product)
# 3. Special 3D vector handling (cross product)
# 4. Composition of multiple operations (length, distance, normalize)
#
# They should be implemented after the basic infrastructure is fully tested.
